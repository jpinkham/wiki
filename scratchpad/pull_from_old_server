Dirs to copy somewhere/backup
=============================
- Home dirs
- /root
- /etc
- User Crontab files -- in /var/spool/cron/crontabs
- all other crons -- /etc/crond

Determine what services/daemons/etc you should install
======================================================

```ps aux``` -- check what's running so you know what to install on new server
```sudo dmesg``` -- see what loads during bootup, to capture what custom drivers/settings you may need
