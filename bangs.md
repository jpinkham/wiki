# bangs


## DuckDuckGo bangs
[DuckDuckGo has a concept of "bangs"](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) that are search shortcuts for many different services.

(!) Make sure your browser is set to have DDG as the default search engine and that your browser address/url field is set to do searches (vs a separate search field in your toolbar)

BONUS: You can use a lot of the same bangs for DDG as for Yubnub

* nvd == National Vulnerability database, for fast search of CVEs
