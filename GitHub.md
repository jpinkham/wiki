Creating/editing
================

Creating a new file within a new directory
------------------------------------------

From the location where you want to create a new directory, click the "Create new file" button.
In the space for the filename, enter the directory name to create, and **add a trailing slash**.
You will then be presented with a blank editor for your new file.  Enter the filename at the top and start editing.

If you simply want to create a new directory, you'll need to create a placeholder file to put into it, and commit it.
GitHub doesn't like empty directories.

Expand/collapse all files at once
---------------------------------

Hold down the Alt key and click on the inverted caret icon in *any* file header.

After clicking the link for "files changed", you can click on any file in the list and it will auto-expand before jumping to the file.
